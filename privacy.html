<h1>Privacy Policy – StarFlight</h1>
<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> February 11, 2026</p>

<p>StarFlight (hereinafter referred to as "the App") is committed to protecting the privacy and security of its users in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and applicable data protection laws. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of information the App processes, how it is used, and your rights as a user.</p>

<hr>

<h2>1. Scope of Application</h2>

<hr>

<h2>2. Data Collection and Usage</h2>
<p>StarFlight <strong>does not collect, transmit, or store personal data</strong>. The App does not require registration, login, or personal identifiers. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>The App does not request or collect your name, email address, or any other identifying information.</li>
<li>No location data, contacts, or device identifiers are collected for personal tracking purposes.</li>
<li>The App does not employ third-party analytics, advertising SDKs, or tracking technologies.</li>
<li>Screen usage, timers, and gameplay activities remain fully local and are not transmitted externally.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>3. Local Storage of Information</h2>

<ul>
<li>Unlocked missions and achievements</li>
<li>Selected spacecraft</li>
<li>Timer settings configured by the user</li>
</ul>
<p>All data remains exclusively on your device and is never transmitted to any server or third-party service. Uninstalling the App will remove all locally stored data.</p>

<hr>

<h2>4. Legal Basis for Processing</h2>
<p>Under the GDPR, StarFlight’s handling of local data is based on <strong>legitimate interest</strong> for the operation and enhancement of the App. No personal data is processed for advertising, marketing, or profiling purposes.</p>

<hr>

<h2>5. User Rights</h2>
<p>Given that StarFlight does not process personal data, the rights provided under GDPR (including access, correction, deletion, restriction, and data portability) are largely inapplicable. Nevertheless, users may contact the developer for inquiries regarding data management or privacy compliance.</p>

<hr>

<h2>6. Data Security</h2>
<p>All locally stored data is protected by the security mechanisms of the iOS operating system. No external transmission occurs, minimizing exposure to unauthorized access. Users are responsible for maintaining the security of their devices.</p>

<hr>

<h2>7. Data Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
<p>StarFlight does not sell, rent, or trade any user data. No personal information is shared with third parties, except when legally required by authorities or in cases to protect the rights of the App or its users.</p>

<hr>

<h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>StarFlight does not knowingly collect or process personal data from children. Since no personal data is collected, the App is safe for use by minors under the supervision of a parent or guardian.</p>

<hr>

<h2>9. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
